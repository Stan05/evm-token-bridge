# EVM Token Bridge

This project represents my work in the LimeAcademy. It is intended to demonstrate my knowledge about Solidity smart contracts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell:
  bridge-localhost      Interact with bridge on localhost
  check                 Check whatever you need
  clean                 Clears the cache and deletes all artifacts
  compile               Compiles the entire project, building all artifacts
  console               Opens a hardhat console
  coverage              Generates a code coverage report for tests
  deploy-localhost      Deploys the bridge and one optional erc20 token on localhost
  flatten               Flattens and prints contracts and their dependencies
  help                  Prints this message
  node                  Starts a JSON-RPC server on top of Hardhat Network
  run                   Runs a user-defined script after compiling the project
  test                  Runs mocha tests
```
