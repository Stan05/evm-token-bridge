# EVM Token Bridge

This project represents my work in the LimeAcademy. It is intended to demonstrate my knowledge about Solidity smart contracts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell:
  check         Check whatever you need
  clean         Clears the cache and deletes all artifacts
  compile       Compiles the entire project, building all artifacts
  console       Opens a hardhat console
  coverage      Generates a code coverage report for tests
  deploy-token  Deploys token on localhost
  flatten       Flattens and prints contracts and their dependencies
  help          Prints this message
  node          Starts a JSON-RPC server on top of Hardhat Network
  run           Runs a user-defined script after compiling the project
  setup-dev     Setup development environment
  setup-testnet Setup testnet environment
  test          Runs mocha tests
```

To setup the Bridge on a network run the following comand

```
 npx hardhat setup-testnet --network <network> --verify-contract true
```
